\section{Sound Exposure Level}

The Sound Exposure Level (SEL) metric determines how much sound you have been exposed to over a period of time.
The longer you hear the sound, the higher the SEL will be.
This is different from OASPL, which simply depends on the mean-square pressure and can remain the same no matter how long the exposure lasts.
